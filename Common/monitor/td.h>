[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1musleep[22m() function suspends execution of the calling thread for (at least) [4musec[24m microseconds.  The sleep may be lengthened slightly by any system activity or by the time spent pro‐
       cessing the call or by the granularity of system timers.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       The [1musleep[22m() function returns 0 on success.  On error, -1 is returned, with [4merrno[24m set to indicate the cause of the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mEINTR  [22mInterrupted by a signal; see [1msignal[22m(7).

       [1mEINVAL [4m[22musec[24m is greater than or equal to 1000000.  (On systems where that is considered an error.)

[1mCONFORMING TO[0m
       4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX.1-2001 declares this function obsolete; use [1mnanosleep[22m(2) instead.  POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of [1musleep[22m().

       On the original BSD implementation, and in glibc before version 2.2.2, the return type of this function is [4mvoid[24m.  The POSIX version returns [4mint[24m, and this is  also  the  prototype  used
       since glibc 2.2.2.

       Only the [1mEINVAL [22merror return is documented by SUSv2 and POSIX.1-2001.

[1mNOTES[0m
       The type [4museconds_t[24m is an unsigned integer type capable of holding integers in the range [0,1000000].  Programs will be more portable if they never mention this type explicitly.  Use

           #include <unistd.h>
           ...
               unsigned int usecs;
           ...
               usleep(usecs);
