Aumtech's AI ChatGPT Client Doc
===============================

This documument describes the instructions for configuring Aumtech's AI
client (arcChatGPTClient.py). It's located is the $TELECOM/Exec/chatgpt/
directory.  

What does it do?
----------------
In short, it gives context the user's response by employing Openai's ChatGPT
chatbot.  

Tasks to be done
----------------
There are three things to be done to get the chatGPT client running properly.
1. Install the virtual environment
2. Obtain and encrypt an OpenAI API Key
3. Configure the chatGPT client to run.

Virtual environment setup for Aumtech's chatGPT Client
------------------------------------------------------

1.  update system as the root user
	# yum update

2.  update python to 3.10.12

	# yum install gcc openssl-devel bzip2-devel libffi-devel

	// Downlod the Python-3.10.12.tgz from the ftp site (user=guest1234_034fa18)
	// to a temp directory.  It resides in the AI_pkgs directory.

	# tar -zxvf Python-3.10.12.tgz
	# cd Python-3.10.12/
	# ./configure --enable-optimizations 
	# make altinstall
	// This will install python-3.10.12 under the /usr/local/bin directory.

3.	install pip
	# yum install epel-release
	# yum install python-pip

4.	install development tools
	# yum install python-devel
	# yum groupinstall 'development tools'

5.	Set up the virtual environment.

	The python scripts, libraries, etc. will be placed in the 
	/home/arc/.ISP/Telecom/Exec/chatgpt directory. 

//	A requirements.txt is delivered with the package.  The requirements.txt file
//	lists the required Python packages for the arcChatGPTClient to run
//	successfully.

//	As the arc user, enter the following commands:
	$ cd /home/arc/.ISP/Telecom/Exec/chatgpt directory
	$ python3.10 -m venv venv	// This will create the venv subdirectory and 3.10.12
	                         	// Python environment.

	$ . venv/bin/activate		// This will activate the python-3.10.12 as the active
	                     		// version.
	$ python --version
	// It should print out 'Python 3.10.12'.  If it doesn't, this must be corrected
	// before continuing.

	(venv) $ /home/arc/.ISP/Telecom/Exec/chatgpt/venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip   // upgrade pip
	(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt 			// install the same packages and versions 
	(venv) $ pip list 			// A list of packages and versions as required for this application will 
	                 			// be displayed.

Obtain and encrypt an OpenAI API Key
------------------------------------
Obtain an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/. It requires creating an openAI
user account.

After getting it, it must be encrypted and placed the $TELECOM/Tables/.TEL.cfg.
The .TEL.cfg has the following [AI] section:
	[AI]
	ChatGPT=OFF
	ChatGPT_model=gpt-3.5-turbo
	ChatGPT_temperature=0.8
	ChatGPT_max_tokens=2000
	ChatGPT_api_key=<encrypted openai key>
	
Replace the contents of the ChatGPT_api_key setting with the unencrypted API key and save the file.
As the arc user, type in the following commands:
	$ cd /home/arc/.ISP/Telecom/Exec/chatgpt
	$ arcChatGPTEncrypt
	// you should see the following line
	//    'Encryption of ChatGPT_api_key in /home/arc/.ISP/Telecom/Tables/.TEL.cfg successfully completed.'
	// otherwise, and error will be printed out.

Configure the chatGPT client to run
-----------------------------------
To configure it to run, simply set the 'ChatGPT' setting to 'ON' in the $TELECOM/Tables/.TEL.cfg and 
restart the system ($ stoptel; $ starttel )
