"LIMITED USE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT"
The terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to the SOFTWARE
delivered by electronic download or other means and derivatives
obtained therefrom, including any copy.  The term SOFTWARE includes
programs and related documentation supplied herewith.  If you have
executed a separate Software Agreement covering the Software supplied
herewith, such Software Agreement will govern.

1.	TITLE AND LICENSE GRANT
The SOFTWARE is copyrighted and/or contains proprietary information
protected by law.  All SOFTWARE, and all copies thereof, are and will
remain the sole property of Aumtech Inc ("Aumtech") or its
Value Added Reseller.  Aumtech hereby grants you a personal, 
non-transferable and non-exclusive right to use the SOFTWARE, in 
whatever form recorded, which is furnished to you under this Agreement 
to be used solely in connection with Aumtech products. Any other use 
of this SOFTWARE from a country in which use is licensed shall 
automatically terminate this license.

Use of SOFTWARE anywhere except in the United States may, in addition
to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, be subject to
the terms and conditions of a separate written agreement signed by the
user. You acknowledge that the SOFTWARE is subject to U.S. export laws
and regulations and any use or transfer must be authorized under those
regulations. You agree that you will not use, distribute, transfer, or
transmit the SOFTWARE, or technical information (even if incorporated
into other products) except in compliance with U.S. export
regulations.

You agree to use your best efforts to see that any user of the
SOFTWARE licensed hereunder complies with the terms and conditions of
this License Agreement and, for SOFTWARE provided in object code
format, to refrain from taking any steps, such as reverse engineering,
reverse assembly or reverse compilation, to derive a source code
equivalent of the SOFTWARE.  If the SOFTWARE is located in the
European Community and you assert that you have a right to and need
for information "indispensable for achieving interoperability of an
independently created computer program" with the SOFTWARE, you shall
submit a request for such information to Aumtech prior to undertaking
any steps to reverse engineer, reverse assemble or reverse compile the
SOFTWARE.  The meaning of "indispensable for achieving
interoperability" shall be interpreted pursuant to Article VI of the
European Community Computer Software Directive 91/205.  If the
information is deemed indispensable by Aumtech, Aumtech will, at its 
sole discretion, (a) provide such information within a 
reasonable period of time, (b) advise you that you are permitted to 
decompile the Software pursuant to guidelines, or (c) offer to provide 
you a refund of up to the cost of your license charges. If information 
is provided under option (a) above, you may be charged a fee.

At the conclusion of the term, you will either return the Software
Products to Aumtech or destroy all Software Products, and so certify
to Aumtech.  Until such destruction or return of Software Products,
all provisions of this Agreement shall continue to apply.

2.	SOFTWARE USE
A.	You are permitted to make a single archive copy, provided the
SOFTWARE shall not otherwise be reproduced, copied, or, except for the
documentation, disclosed to others in whole or in part.  Any such copy
shall contain the same copyright notice and proprietary marking,
including diskette markings, appearing on the original SOFTWARE.

B.	You understand and acknowledge that the SOFTWARE comprises
examples of software applications which may be used by you to
understand typical applications usable with Aumtech software. 
You are permitted to adapt the sample SOFTWARE applications for use in your own
applications, and to then distribute such applications through your
chain of distribution to end users in object code form without payment
to Aumtech.  The SOFTWARE, in its normal operation, may access and
download elements of software or data from resources which are
external to the computer or device running the SOFTWARE.  Aumtech
does not undertake to provide such external resources or servers and
specifically disclaims any representation or warranty as to the
availability, quality or performance of such resources or whether they
may contain any defects which may affect performance of the Software
or a computer or other system on which it is running.  Aumtech shall
not be responsible for provision of any communications facilities or
the costs associated with communications.

3.	NO WARRANTY
A. 	You understand and acknowledge that the SOFTWARE is provided
on an AS-IS basis, without warranty of any kind.  Specifically,
Aumtech does not warrant that the functions of the SOFTWARE will meet
your requirements or that SOFTWARE operation will be error-free or
uninterrupted.

B.	Aumtech SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF
NONINFRINGEMENT, AND YOU AGREE TO ASSUME ANY RISK THAT THE SOFTWARE OR
ANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM THE SOFTWARE MAY INFRINGE THE PATENT,
COPYRIGHT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY.

C.	YOU ASSUME THE RISK OF ANY AND ALL DAMAGE OR LOSS FROM USE, OR
INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE.

D.	Unless a separate agreement for software maintenance is
entered into between you and Aumtech, Aumtech bears no
responsibility for supplying assistance for fixing or for
communicating known errors to you pertaining to the SOFTWARE supplied
hereunder.

E.	Aumtech, ITS AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS AND AGENTS
MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states or other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of
implied warranties or limitations on how long an implied warranty
lasts, so the above limitations may not apply to you.  This warranty
gives you specific legal rights and you may also have other rights
which vary from one state or jurisdiction to another.

4.	FEEDBACK
If you provide Aumtech with reports of bugs or errors in the
SOFTWARE, reports on the operation of the SOFTWARE or any changes or
modifications proposed or suggested by you to the Software Products
during the term of this Agreement in connection with the evaluating
and testing thereof ("Feedback"), Aumtech shall have all the rights
to use such Feedback at its discretion including, but not limited to
the incorporation of such suggested changes or modifications into
Aumtech software and the right to assign, license or to otherwise
transfer to third parties the software so changed or modified without
obligation or recourse to you. You hereby grant and assign to Aumtech
and its licensees all rights and licenses as are necessary to
incorporate Feedback into the Software and/or other Aumtech products
and to distribute and otherwise commercially exploit the Software
and/or other Aumtech products without payment or accounting to you.

4.	EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITIES
A.	YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE REMEDY AGAINST Aumtech, ITS
AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS, AND AGENTS FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE
CAUSED BY ANY DEFECT OR FAILURE IN THE SOFTWARE REGARDLESS OF THE FORM
OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE THE REPLACEMENT OF Aumtech FURNISHED
SOFTWARE, PROVIDED SUCH SOFTWARE IS RETURNED TO Aumtech.  THIS SHALL
BE EXCLUSIVE OF ALL OTHER REMEDIES AGAINST Aumtech, ITS AFFILIATES,
CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS OR AGENTS, EXCEPT FOR YOUR RIGHT TO CLAIM
DAMAGES FOR BODILY INJURY TO ANY PERSON.

B.	REGARDLESS OF ANY OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
Aumtech NOR ITS AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS OR AGENTS SHALL BE
LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) SUSTAINED OR INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE
USE, OPERATION, OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, OR FOR DAMAGES DUE TO
CAUSES BEYOND THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF Aumtech, ITS AFFILIATES,
CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS AND AGENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY SERVICE,
PRODUCTS OR ACTION OF ANY OTHER PERSON.

C.	This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and
governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT AND UNDERSTAND IT,
AND THAT BY DOWNLOADING THE SOFTWARE YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT, EXCEPT FOR SEPARATE
WRITTEN AGREEMENTS BETWEEN Aumtech AND YOU, THIS AGREEMENT IS THE
COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES OF THE
PARTIES.  THIS AGREEMENT SUPERSEDES ALL PRIOR ORAL AGREEMENTS,
PROPOSALS OR UNDERSTANDINGS, AND ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN US
RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT.
