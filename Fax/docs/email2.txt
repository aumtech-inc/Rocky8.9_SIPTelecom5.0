I forgot a couple of items which may be helpful.

The following files are delivered with the ARCFax package:
	$TELECOM/Exec/FaxServerAnalog        
	$TELECOM/Exec/FaxServerT1           
	$TELECOM/Exec/FaxServerE1           
	$TELECOM/Applications/lib/libARCFax.a 
	$TELECOM/Applications/include/ARCFax.h
	$TELECOM/Applications/makegen.fax    
	$TELECOM/Tables/FaxTextDefaultsConfig.sample.txt.

Regarding the Resource Manager and the $TELECOM/Tables/resource.cfg file,
the TEL_SendFax() and TEL_RecvFax() APIs request fax resources from
the resource manager.  The first and second fields must be FAX and VFX
respectively.  An example file with valid fax entries is:
	FAX|VFX|dxxxB13C1
	FAX|VFX|dxxxB13C2
	FAX|VFX|dxxxB13C3
	FAX|VFX|dxxxB13C4
	SIR|contin-digit|vrxB1C1
	SIR|contin-digit|vrxB1C2
	SIR|contin-digit|vrxB1C3

The resource manager reads the $TELECOM/Tables/resource.cfg
at startup only, so any changes to the file will not take effect until
either Telecom is re-booted or the resource manager is killed.  The 

Also, when testing the applications, be sure to monitor the resource 
manager when the fax applications are running.  This is done thru the 
tel_monitor.  After starting up tel_monitor, choose
option 4 (Resource Status) from the menu.
