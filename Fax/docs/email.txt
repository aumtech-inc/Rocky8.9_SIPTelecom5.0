Hi everyone,

I have the new TEL_SetFaxTextDefaults() API completed.  

Other modifications that you should be aware to make when
re-compiling the fax applications (apitest) are:
	- An additional parameter (char *) has been
	  added to the TEL_BuildFaxList API.  This
	  parameter is currently ignored and is 
	  reserved for future use.
	- I renamed the arcFax.h include to ARCFax.h.  
	  The package is ARCFax, the library is libARCFax.a,
	  now the include file is ARCFax.h - consistant.
	- Remember, the Resoure Manager must be running (specified in
	  .TEL.cfg); the resource manager reads the
	  $TELECOM/Tables/resource.cfg file - if you make changes to the file,
	  they will not become effective until you either kill the resource
	  manager or restart Telecom.

Other key notes:
	- I put the version as 3.0 - is that ok?
	- I am going through the Fax users guide which was sent
	  to me earlier this week.  From the Linkon document, 
	  it said that once a call is converted to a fax call, it
	  can no longer be converted to a voice call.  That is
	  no longer the case.  It is set back to voice immediately
	  after a fax transmission.  This should be tested.

The attachment is the latest design document.  George, I placed 
changes in it (the document only - not code) to respond to
your request regarding TEL_ScheduleFax() delete_flag, as well as
the  TEL_BuildFaxList() operation and eject_page parameters.  

For the delete flag, currently 1 means delete after successful
transmission and 2 means not to delete it.  How about #defines of
DELETE_ON_SUCCESS (1) and RETAIN_ON_SUCCESSS (2).

For the operation parameter, currently 0 means append and 1
means overwrite.  I suggested having a #define of APPEND = 0
and OVERWRITE = 1.  This way, current applications would not
have to be modified.  Likewise for eject_page, 0 currently means
'dont eject' while 1 is to eject a page.  My #defines are 
DONT_EJECT_PAGE (0) and EJECT_PAGE (1).

Also, I am assuming that the values in the list files remain as numbers,
not as the descriptive names.  For example, the line in a list file of
	/fax/header.tif |TIF |1|1|0|logo
would remain as is, and not be changed to
	/fax/header.tif |TIF |1|1|DONT_EJECT_PAGE|logo

Is my assumption correct? Please let me know as I would like to 
wrap this up this week.

Thanks,

Dan
