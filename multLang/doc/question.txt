where did you get the numbers?

2) French - do you have $TELECOM/phrases/FRENCH/... set up? How can telecom
resolve male/female?

3) FRENCH/phr.GenericApp
	-	remaining tag is a duplicate
	-	where is mainCurrencyUnit2

4) male/female  -  IN_MONEY/IN_TIME ;  so IN_MONEY means male, not money?

5) playBalance() - performs a TEL_GetGlobal($LANGUAGE), then compares with
					something else.
